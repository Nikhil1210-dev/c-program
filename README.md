# 🧮 Basic C Programs 

This directory contains a collection of foundational **C programs** created for practicing key programming concepts like arrays, loops, recursion, functions, and control structures. All programs are designed to run in **VS Code** with GCC.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- GCC compiler
- VS Code
- C/C++ Extension by Microsoft

### ✅ Setup

1. Install VS Code
2. Install **C/C++ extension**
3. Install GCC:
   - **Windows:** [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt install build-essential`
   - **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`

## 🧪 Compilation & Execution

To compile and run any C file:
```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name.exe
./program_name.exe
```

Or, set up a `tasks.json` file for easier builds in VS Code.
